## Gotek Direct Access Mode  
  
<br><br>
Example code on how to switch the Gotek in Direct Access Mode, by selecting Track 255 with the floppy controller on the MSX.  
Only for MSX computers with a **S279X** (or compatible) floppy drive controller. (Mostly Philips MSX)
  
#### Do not use this tool with real floppy drives, the knocking could misalign the heads of the drive. Use at your own risk!.
