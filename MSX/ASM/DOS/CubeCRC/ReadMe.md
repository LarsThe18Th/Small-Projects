### - Info -
This MSX-DOS test tool calculates the CRC32 value of a 64k ROM cartridge in Slot 1 or Slot 2 in a MSX.  
It was written for quickly testing the <ins>Cubedroid - Holiday Special</ins> game cartridge.
<br/><br/>  
### - Note -
If the result `CRC = deab7e4e`, then something probably went wrong because this is the CRC of a 64k file filled with all #FF.  
Probably because the cartridge is in the wrong slot or not inserted at all.
