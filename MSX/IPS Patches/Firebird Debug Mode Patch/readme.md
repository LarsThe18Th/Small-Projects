## Hidden Debug Mode in Firebird  

I discovered a hidden password that can launch a debug mode in Firebird.  
In this debug mode, you are invulnerable to enemies, you get all the items/stones and level data is shown on screen.  
  
Usage:
- Apply the IPS patch to the Firebird ROM file
- Enter Password AAAAA in the password screen to activate debug mode.
