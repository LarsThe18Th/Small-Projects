- BTTF-Unlimited lives.ips
- BTTF-Unlimited Shoes.ips
- BTTF-Level Select.ips (Thanks to **_BiFi_**, he updated the Level Select Menu for all 9 Levels)


 **How to enter the Level Select menu.**  
Hold [Select] + [UP] + [LEFT] keys and push [Space]. (Thanks to **_MrHydragon_**)  

**Note:**  
Some keyboards have trouble with the key combination above  
therefore i have included the BTTF.tcl script for OpenMSX to do the keypress for you.  


**The game hints this feature in Level 2**
